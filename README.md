UCDavis SQL for Data Science – Query Summary

This repository contains the SQL practice work I completed as part of the UCDavis SQL for Data Science course.

The SQL file includes examples of:

1. Basic SQL Selection

Selecting specific columns

Using DISTINCT values

Sorting with ORDER BY

2. Filtering Data

WHERE conditions

Using IN, BETWEEN, LIKE

Combining conditions with AND / OR

3. Aggregate Functions

COUNT, SUM, MAX, and grouped calculations

Using GROUP BY and HAVING to summarize data

4. Table Joins

LEFT JOINs across multiple tables

Joining tracks, albums, artists, invoices, and customers

5. Subqueries

Using nested queries inside WHERE conditions

6. Set Operations & String Functions

UNION to combine results

Text transformations like LOWER, UPPER, SUBSTR

Creating derived fields (e.g., formatted addresses, IDs)

7. Null Handling

Finding records with missing values using IS NULL

The queries demonstrate practical skills applied across two datasets:

A salary range classification table

The Chinook music store database

This collection served as hands-on practice for learning core SQL concepts and patterns used in real data analysis.
